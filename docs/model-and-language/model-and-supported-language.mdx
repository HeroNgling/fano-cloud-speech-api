## Mixed-Language Support

One of Fano's key differentiators is our ability to accurately transcribe mixed-language speech. Our models can handle:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Code-Switching" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Seamlessly transcribe when speakers switch between languages mid-sentence.
    
    **Example:** "今日我哋要 discuss 吓個 project timeline"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Mixed Scripts" icon="language">
    Output transcripts with appropriate character sets for each language.
    
    **Example:** "The meeting is at 三點半 in conference room B"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Automatic Detection" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Automatically detect language switches without manual configuration.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Language Detection

### Automatic Detection

Set `language` to `auto` for automatic language detection:

```json
{
  "audio_url": "https://example.com/audio.wav",
  "language": "auto"
}
```

The response includes detected language information:

```json
{
  "transcript": "...",
  "detected_language": "zh-HK",
  "language_segments": [
    {"language": "zh-HK", "start": 0.0, "end": 5.2},
    {"language": "en", "start": 5.2, "end": 8.1},
    {"language": "zh-HK", "start": 8.1, "end": 12.0}
  ]
}
```

### Specifying Language

For best accuracy when you know the language:

```json
{
  "audio_url": "https://example.com/audio.wav",
  "language": "zh-HK"  // Specify primary language
}
```

## Choosing the Right Model

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Your Audio Source">
    Phone recordings → `telephony`
    Meeting recordings → `meeting`
    Podcasts/broadcasts → `broadcast`
    Other → `general`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Consider Audio Quality">
    - High quality (16kHz+): Any model
    - Phone quality (8kHz): Use `telephony`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Evaluate Multi-Speaker Needs">
    - Single speaker: Any model
    - Multiple speakers with diarization needed: `meeting`
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Performance Tips

<Tip>
**For best accuracy:**
- Use the model that matches your audio source
- Provide high-quality audio when possible (16kHz+, minimal noise)
- Enable keyword biasing for domain-specific terms
- Specify the language if known (rather than using auto-detection)
