## Models & Supported Languages

When you transcribe audio, you need to set the `languageCode` in your `config` to one of the following values:

| Language Code | Language | Description |
|---------------|----------|-------------|
| `yue` | Cantonese | Optimized for Cantonese speech |
| `cmn` | Mandarin | Optimized for Mandarin Chinese speech |
| `en` | English | Optimized for English speech |
| `yue-x-auto` | Multilingual | Cantonese, Mandarin, and English with automatic language detection |

## Choosing the Right Model

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Single Language Audio" icon="microphone">
    If your audio contains only one language, use the specific language code (`yue`, `cmn`, or `en`) for best accuracy.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mixed Language Audio" icon="language">
    For audio with code-switching between Cantonese, Mandarin, and English, use `yue-x-auto`. This model seamlessly handles multilingual conversations common in Hong Kong and Singapore.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example Configuration

```json
{
  "config": {
    "languageCode": "yue-x-auto",
    "encoding": "LINEAR16",
    "enableAutomaticPunctuation": true
  },
  "audio": {
    "uri": "https://example.com/audio.wav"
  }
}
```

<Tip>
The `yue-x-auto` model is recommended for most use cases in Hong Kong and Singapore, where code-switching between languages is common.
