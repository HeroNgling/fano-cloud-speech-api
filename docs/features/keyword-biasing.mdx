## Overview

Keyword Biasing allows you to improve transcription accuracy for domain-specific terminology. By passing a list of keywords (e.g., banking products, medical terms, or proper names) in the API request, the model will prioritize these terms during transcription.

This feature is particularly useful for:

- **Brand names** and product names
- **Industry jargon** and technical terms
- **Proper names** of people, places, or organizations
- **Acronyms** and abbreviations specific to your domain

## Enable Feature

To enable keyword biasing, include the `speechContexts` parameter in your request configuration.

**Example Configuration:**

```json
{
  "config": {
    "languageCode": "yue-x-auto",
    "encoding": "LINEAR16",
    "enableAutomaticPunctuation": true,
    "speechContexts": [
      {
        "phrases": ["Fano Labs", "Callinter", "speech analytics"]
      }
    ]
  },
  "audio": {
    "uri": "{audio_uri}"
  }
}
```
